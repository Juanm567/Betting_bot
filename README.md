# What is this?
## Discord bot to run simulations and calculations on the best odds and picks when it comes to sport's betting.
Start of the project will just focus primarily on NBA games utilizing WebScraping to gather data which will get sent to a database which then gets passed on to my main program to finally be displayed to my user via a discord bot, calculations will be made utilizing my own team power system

### Version 1:
I will only work on cleaning up the data and getting the version one of the project ready to be published on github will only be using
- PPG
- Active or not
- Team win/loss numbers for the current season
