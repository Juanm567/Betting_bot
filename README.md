# What is this?
## Discord bot to run simulations and calculations on the best odds and picks when it comes to sport's betting.
Start of the project will just focus primarily on NBA games utilizing WebScraping to gather data which will get sent to a database which then gets passed on to my main program to finally be displayed to my user via a discord bot, calculations will be made utilizing my own team power system

### Power System
So far the power system utilizes the following metrics
- ppg (points per game)
- injuries
- starters / benched players
### Future will include
- Managers/trainers
- Trades
- Previous games performance
- TBD
### A timeline of what ive been doing for anyone keeping up with the bot
- 5/19: I learned about packages and modules in python, using my knowledge from OOP in c++ and java I thought I would structure my program utilizing a OOP approach and so today i started working on my classes and in making an optimal project structure focusing in a scalable enough design and a modular program. I Still have more to learn and implement here. Also learned about game theory which could also be helpful in making my bot accurate once i start writting the calculations.
