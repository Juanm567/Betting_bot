# What is this?
## Discord bot to run simulations and calculations on the best odds and picks when it comes to sport's betting.
Start of the project will just focus primarily on NBA games utilizing WebScraping to gather data which will get sent to a database which then gets passed on to my main program to finally be displayed to my user via a discord bot, calculations will be made utilizing my own team power system

### Power System
So far the power system utilizes the following metrics
- ppg (points per game)
- injuries
- starters / benched players
- Status of the player 
### Future will include
- Managers/trainers
- Trades
- Previous games performance
- TBD
